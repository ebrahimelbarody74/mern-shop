00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:03.765
(uplifting energetic music)

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.640
- Jets flying through the
air really, really quick

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.650
make it really hard to
figure out a camera track,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.420
and so we had to utilize GPS data

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.970
from the actual camera
planes in combination

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.190
with USGS topographical data

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.050
to actually plot out various points

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.250
and then rework our light rigs

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.230
to be able to actually
properly coordinate things,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.400
as jets moving as fast as they
do actually hit curvature.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.750
That changes lighting in
extremely subtle ways.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.240
- The special effects department built

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.460
four bespoke high performance Batmobiles

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.170
and each version of the
vehicle was engineered

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.790
and constructed for a specific purpose,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.140
and they were all built from scratch,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.870
because each Batmobile was
kind of custom tailored

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.950
for a specific job.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.440
They didn't all fit the
design spec exactly.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.670
For example, the jumping Batmobile,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.350
once it hit the ground
and it stood back up

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.210
on that long throw suspension,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.620
it looked like the daddy long legs version

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.453
of the Batmobile.

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:01.620
At a certain point had to
take over and replace that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.970
along with the wet ground

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.983
and the fire reflecting off the water.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.010
- The yellow smoke was something
that we wanted to keep open

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.720
for the audience to
figure out what this is.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.430
At the same time, I always thought of it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.620
as sort of announcement of the creatures,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.290
whether it's their smell
or their pollution.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.960
When you see a big cloud wave coming,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.560
there's something bad behind it.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
That sequence was so sensitive to contrast

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.340
whether you see him or not

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.010
and so we actually had to
render those shots twice,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.320
one past with the machines
and then one without

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.880
and we sort of in the grading

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.133
did a live mixing and the finished result.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.330
- 50% if not more of our sets

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.280
did have a water feature of some kinds.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.460
I'll let Craig kind of
chat to the integration

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.860
between Dan Sudek's massive rigs

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.290
and then the islands working
combining those two worlds.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.620
- Dan's rigs gave us a
foundation that was rock steady.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.660
Everything possible that was safe,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.950
but safe is not what you want

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.190
so everything needed
augmentation, a layer on top,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.090
basically the whole front layer of it.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.090
- Well, we switched to a stereo head rig.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.580
We had been using on the
first film a single camera,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.140
but the cameras were lightweight enough

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.220
that we could go with stereo,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.680
but really the key was the facial system.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.930
We put everything into a neural network

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.510
and the beauty of that
is when you're changing

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.740
from pose to pose,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.800
every point on the face
understands what every other point

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.050
on the face should be doing.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.903
- They took it.
